as Video on Demand and IPTV have been widely deployed.
These new enhanced video services are usually delivered via
streaming technologies over IP-based networks to set-top boxes
(STB). Unfortunately, such networks are commonly referred
to as packet-based best-effort networks that cannot guarantee
the correct delivery of the transmitted data. As such, network
impairments like packet loss can cause severe visual degradations
during video playback. Current existing methodologies
for the subjective quality assessment of video sequences pose
tight restrictions on viewing conditions and experiment duration.
As a consequence, these methodologies cannot be used
for the quality assessment of full length movies in real-life
conditions. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed and
used to evaluate the influence of packet loss and frame freezes
on the perceived visual quality of full length movies.},

IP (VolP) applications based upon a reduction of the
ITU-T's E-Model to transport level, measurable
quantities. In the process, 1) we identify the relevant
transport level quantities, 2) we discuss the tradeoffs
between placing the monitors within the VolP
gateways versus placement of the monitors within the
transport path, and 3) we identify several areas where
further work and consensus within the industry are
required. We discover that the relevant transport level
quantities are the delay, network packet loss and the
decoder's de-jitter buffer packet loss. We find that an
in-path monitor requires the definition of a reference
de-jitter buffer implementation to estimate voice
quality based upon observed transport measurements.
Finally, we suggest that more studies are required,
which evaluate the quality of various VolP codecs in
the presence of representative packet loss patterns.},

Considering judgment as an understandable phenomenon allows access to the research
literature examining judgments in other contexts and to the research methodologies
needed to study the judgments needed for specific forecas:ing tasks. Such research can
clarify how much forecasts are to be trusted and how forecasts might be improved (by
evaluating and improving their judgmental component). Indeed, just identifying where
judgment enters a forecast can make it more useful. The approach outlined here offers a
complement both to seeing ‘judgmental forecasting’ as an irreducible whole and to
focusing primarily on a few judgmental subtasks (e.g., assessing confidence intervals). It
argues that such focused empirical study can be profitably performed on other subtasks,
creating a more comprehensive picture of judgment.},

	url = {file:///home/user/Downloads/PhD_thesis_egger_v20_corrections_for_upload.pdf},
	abstract = {Quality-of-experience (QoE) of interactive applications transmitted over TCP/IP
networks has recently gained considerable attention, and is mainly in uenced by
transmission delays due to TCP/IP's retransmission characteristic. This thesis shows
that interactive Internet applications share the commonality of a recurring request-
response cycle that is highly vulnerable to such transmission delays. In the context of
two prototypical services, interactive Internet telephony and browser based applica-
tions, the impact of transmission delays on QoE is analysed. In terms of interactive
Internet telephony, a surface structure analysis of delay impaired voice calls reveals
several changes in conversation behaviour caused by the delay. From this analy-
sis, two conversational metrics are derived that capture the in uence of delay on
human-to-human conversations. Using these metrics as additional input parame-
ters, an update to the E-Model is proposed that enhances prediction performance
considerably. For browser based applications, a novel subjective testing method-
ology is presented that establishes a realistic ow-experience in the resulting web
browsing sessions. Data from two lab studies and a ⬚eld trial proves the ability of
this test methodology to provide reliable and consistent results across di⬚erent con-
texts. In terms of the relationship between waiting time and QoE for browser based
applications, this thesis postulates the WQL hypothesis: the relationship between
"
W
aiting time and resulting
Q
oE is
L
ogarithmic". With the acquired data from
the three studies, the WQL is veri⬚ed for ⬚le downloads and simple web browsing.
Contrary, in the context of complex web browsing the WQL has to be rejected. A
following analysis reveals several challenges and practical issues that complicate the
use of the WQL for this service. Additionally, it identi⬚es the subjectively perceived
page-load-time as an interaction based measure of waiting time and promising input
parameter for novel QoE models. Finally, a human perception model, that considers
interaction quality performance aspects in the quality formation process, and that
explains (re-)actions to (conversational) input signals in the form of active output
signals is derived},

parameters such as user perception, experience and expectations
with technical parameters such as application- and network-level
Quality of Service (QoS). For service or network providers, it
is important to understand the quantitative relationship between
QoE and these technical parameters in order to manage the userperceived
quality. This paper investigates the different impacts
of a) provisioning and b) delivery problems due to insufficient
resources on QoE, leading to the QoE provisioning-delivery
hysteresis (QoE-PDH). We demonstrate the QoE-PDH for Voiceover-
IP, live video streaming, and web browsing based on existing
measurement studies. The results clearly quantify the necessity to
control quality, instead of suffering from uncontrollable impacts
like packet loss caused by congestion. The implementation and
the limitations of the QoE-PDH in the current Internet is
shown using the example of Skype. Afterwards we discuss how
these results can be used to enhance energy-efficient service
provisioning and delivery in the Future Internet.},

duration sufficient for Quality of Experience assessment? In
this paper, we present the results of a comparative user study
that tests whether quality perception and rating behavior
may be different if video clip durations are longer. We did
not find strong overall MOS differences between clip
durations, but the three longer clips (60, 120 and 240
seconds) were rated slightly more positively than the three
shorter durations under comparison (10, 15 and 30 seconds).
This difference was most apparent when high quality videos
were presented. However, we did not find an interaction
between content class and the duration effect itself.
Furthermore, methodological implications of these results
are discussed.},

At issue is the relative effect of the initial expectation level and the degree of positive or negative disconfirmation on affective judgments following product exposure.

To test this notion, 243 college students responded to expectation and disconfirmation measures in a 3-stage field study of reactions to a recently introduced automobile model. These measures were later related to postexposure affect and intention variables in a hierarchical analysis of variance design. Although the results support earlier conclusions that level of expectation is related to postexposure judgments, it is also shown that the disconfirmation experience may have an independent and equally significant impact.},

	abstract = {This article considers current research in computer-supported cooperative work
(CSCW), computer-mediated communication (CMC), and distributed artificial
intelligence (DAI). These areas need an articulated model of social contexts to
bridge the persisting gap between social and technological dimensions in computer
system design and use.
A conceptual model of context is presented to account for both cooperotionconflict
ond communication-negotiation processes. The model conceives of contexts
as including not only physical objects and other people but also social norms
which influence both individuals and organizations. It assumes that computer
system use occurs in social scenarios in which the features cannot be reduced to
any type of input or data in the world that designers and users con process along
with other informotion coming from the current task. The model is built on three
levels: from social contexts OS normative order (level I), to specific and intrinsically
complex situations (Level 2). to person-computer interactions for the performance
of particular tasks (Level 3).
The model has three main implications. First, Human-Computer Interaction
(MI) studies-especially scenario-based design-may profit from a fresh topdown
approach to designers’ and users’ mental mode/s taking into account normotive
social processes which have been neglected in previous research. Second,
CSCW may realize how deeply discrepant perspectives affect multi-agent environments
and why in real working life negotiation is intertwined with cooperation.
Designers may use this insight to design systems ollowing more place for negotiot/
on among actors. Third, we should dismiss the view that CM locks adequate
social cues ond fosters impulsive behavior. Cognitive processes such as categorization,
stereotype construction, and social identification con make electronic
environments even more strongly sensible to social norms than face-to-face communication.
Context, according to our model, is not restricted to the physical copresence
of other people but consists mainly of processes providing situations
with socially recognizable meaning.},

@phdthesis{eugene_myakotnykh_adaptive_2008,
	title = {Adaptive {Speech} {Quality} in {Voice}-over-{IP} {Communications}},
	abstract = {The quality of VoIP communication relies significantly on the network that transports the voice packets because this network does not usually guarantee the available bandwidth, delay, and loss that are critical for real-time voice traffic. The solution proposed here is to manage the voice-over-IP stream dynamically, changing parameters as needed to assure quality.
The main objective of this dissertation is to develop an adaptive speech encoding system that can be applied to conventional (telephony-grade) and wideband voice communications. This comprehensive study includes the investigation and development of three key components of the system. First, to manage VoIP quality dynamically, a tool is needed to measure real-time changes in quality. The E-model, which exists for narrowband communication, is extended to a single computational technique that measures speech quality for narrowband and wideband VoIP codecs. This part of the dissertation also develops important theoretical work in the area of wideband telephony.
The second system component is a variable speech-encoding algorithm. Although VoIP performance is affected by multiple codecs and network-based factors, only three factors can be managed dynamically: voice payload size, speech compression and jitter buffer management. Using an existing adaptive jitter-buffer algorithm, voice packet-size and compression variation are studied as they affect speech quality under different network conditions. This study explains the relationships among multiple parameters as they affect speech transmission and its resulting quality.
Then, based on these two components, the third system component is a novel adaptive-rate control algorithm that establishes the interaction between a VoIP sender and receiver, and manages voice quality in real-time. Simulations demonstrate that the system provides better average voice quality than traditional VoIP.},

	abstract = {Utility functions, describing the value of a good or a
resource from an end user’s point of view, are widely used as an
important ingredient for all sorts of microeconomic models. In
the context of resource allocation in communication networks, a
logarithmic version of utility usually serves as the standard example
due to its simplicity and mathematical tractability. In this
paper we argue that indeed there are much more (and better)
reasons to consider logarithmic utilities as really paradigmatic, at
least when it comes to characterizing user experience with specific
telecommunication services. We justify this claim with the help
of recent results from Quality of Experience (QoE) research, and
demonstrate that, especially for Voice-over-IP and mobile
broadband scenarios, there is increasing evidence that user experience
and satisfaction follows logarithmic laws. Finally, we go
even one step further and put these results into the broader context
of the Weber-Fechner Law, a key principle in psychophysics
describing the general relationship between the magnitude of a
physical stimulus and its perceived intensity within the human
sensory system.},

for the evolution of the future Internet. In this paper we
introduce a framework for QoE management for video
streaming systems based on H.264/SVC codec, the scalable
extension of H.264/AVC. A relevant feature is to control the
user perceived quality of experience (QoE) by exploiting
parameters offered by SVC. A proper design of a control
mechanisms requires the quantification of the main influence
parameters on the QoE. For this purpose, we conducted an
extensive measurement study and quantified the influence of
i) video resolution, ii) scaling method, iii) network conditions
in terms of packet loss and iv) video content types on the
QoE by means of the SSIM and PSNR full-reference metrics.
Further, we discuss the trade-off between these different
control knobs and their influence on the QoE.},

@phdthesis{blazej_lewcio_management_2012,
	title = {Management of {Speech} and {Video} {Telephony} {Quality} in {Heterogeneous} {Wireless} {Networks}},
	abstract = {This dissertation shows how networking research and quality engineering can
be combined to successfully manage the quality when speech and video telephony
is delivered in heterogeneous wireless networks. Nomadic use of services
requires an intelligent management of ongoing transmission, and to make the
best of available resources many fundamental trade-o⬚s must be considered.
Network coverage versus throughput and reliability of a connection is one
key aspect, e⬚ciency versus robustness of signal compression is another. To
successfully manage services, user-perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) in
heterogeneous networks must be known, and the perception of changing quality
must be understood. These issues are addressed in this dissertation, in
particular focusing on the perception of quality changes due to switching
between diverse networks, codecs, and bit rates during ongoing calls. Even
though related work in the domain of perception-based management of quality
in wireless networks already exists, the fact of how the process of quality
adaptation itself a⬚ects a user is neglected. Moreover, existing studies of timevarying
quality are not tightly integrated in the management of speech and
video telephony in heterogeneous wireless networks.
To tackle the addressed issues, a research testbed was created and a number
of user experiments was performed. The testbed enables to perform interactive
as well as passive tests, and to collect data in form of speech and video
signal that would be otherwise directly presented to the user, system logs,
and network traces. A variety of transmission parameters can be adjusted in
real-time, and in particular an algorithm that enables to seamlessly switch
between various speech and video codecs during an ongoing transmission has
been developed in the frame of this thesis. To cope with the multitude of the
supported features, an additional testbed controller reduces the complexity of
performing an experiment, and an event-based concept of test de⬚nition allows
to automatically process any transmission scenarios, including conditions
in which the streaming properties are changed multiple times during ongoing
transmission.},

quality of mobile value-added services and have a further discussion of the
relationships among service quality, perceived value, customer satisfaction, and
post-purchase intention. Structural equation modeling and multiple regression
analysis were used to analyze the data collected from college and graduate students of
fifteen major universities in Taiwan. The main findings are as follows: (1) service
quality positively influences both perceived value and customer satisfaction; (2)
perceived value positively influences on both customer satisfaction and post-purchase
intention; (3) customer satisfaction positively influences post-purchase intention; (4)
service quality has an indirect positive influence on post-purchase intention through
customer satisfaction or perceived value; (5) among the dimensions of service quality,
“customer service and system reliability” is most influential on perceived value and
customer satisfaction, and the influence of “content quality” ranks second; (6) the
proposed model is proven with the effectiveness in explaining the relationships
among service quality, perceived value, customer satisfaction, and post-purchase
intention in mobile added-value services.},

	abstract = {This research study is tl1e third in o series of surveys exploring the l11Cldence of
sinwltoneous media usage among a national smnple of US cons11111ers. The research is
based on 12,322. respondents ·u)ho were sampled via an online network. The findings show
that sinwlttmeous media usage. ie multiple exposures to ·uarious media forms at a single
point in time for the same media conSIIII/er, occurs in and among a substantial portion of
the US media population. The existence of simultaneous media exposures, created by
multi-tasking cons:JmJers, is a fact in forlay'r; nwrlia marketplace. The existence of
simultaneous media exposures undermines most current media 111easuremcnt systems as
they are defined as isolated cnvironmmts. Thus, the clwllcngc of this paper is for media
management to rethink how media evaluations slzould be rethought for the 21 sf century.},
