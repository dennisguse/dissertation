  abstract = {Since the introduction of digital television, new services such
as Video on Demand and IPTV have been widely deployed.
These new enhanced video services are usually delivered via
streaming technologies over IP-based networks to set-top boxes
(STB). Unfortunately, such networks are commonly referred
to as packet-based best-effort networks that cannot guarantee
the correct delivery of the transmitted data. As such, network
impairments like packet loss can cause severe visual degradations
during video playback. Current existing methodologies
for the subjective quality assessment of video sequences pose
tight restrictions on viewing conditions and experiment duration.
As a consequence, these methodologies cannot be used
for the quality assessment of full length movies in real-life
conditions. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed and
used to evaluate the influence of packet loss and frame freezes
on the perceived visual quality of full length movies.},

Subjects in the anchored condition first judge whether a specified number (the anchor) is higher or lower than the true value before estimating each quantity. The anchors are set at predetermined percentiles of the distribution of estimates in the calibration group (15th and 85th percentiles in this study). This procedure permits the transformation of anchored estimates into percentiles in the calibration group, allows pooling of results across problems, and provides a natural measure of the size of the effect. The authors illustrate the method by a demonstration that the initial judgment of the anchor is susceptible to an anchoring-like bias and by an analysis of the relation between anchoring and subjective confidence.},

IP (VolP) applications based upon a reduction of the
ITU-T's E-Model to transport level, measurable
quantities. In the process, 1) we identify the relevant
transport level quantities, 2) we discuss the tradeoffs
between placing the monitors within the VolP
gateways versus placement of the monitors within the
transport path, and 3) we identify several areas where
further work and consensus within the industry are
required. We discover that the relevant transport level
quantities are the delay, network packet loss and the
decoder's de-jitter buffer packet loss. We find that an
in-path monitor requires the definition of a reference
de-jitter buffer implementation to estimate voice
quality based upon observed transport measurements.
Finally, we suggest that more studies are required,
which evaluate the quality of various VolP codecs in
the presence of representative packet loss patterns.},

Considering judgment as an understandable phenomenon allows access to the research
literature examining judgments in other contexts and to the research methodologies
needed to study the judgments needed for specific forecas:ing tasks. Such research can
clarify how much forecasts are to be trusted and how forecasts might be improved (by
evaluating and improving their judgmental component). Indeed, just identifying where
judgment enters a forecast can make it more useful. The approach outlined here offers a
complement both to seeing ‘judgmental forecasting’ as an irreducible whole and to
focusing primarily on a few judgmental subtasks (e.g., assessing confidence intervals). It
argues that such focused empirical study can be profitably performed on other subtasks,
creating a more comprehensive picture of judgment.},

  abstract = {Network protocols are usually tested in operational networks or in simulated environments. With the former approach it is not easy to set and control the various operational parameters such as bandwidth, delays, queue sizes. Simulators are easier to control, but they are often only an approximate model of the desired setting, especially for what regards the various traffic generators (both producers and consumers) and their interaction with the protocol itself.In this paper we show how a simple, yet flexible and accurate network simulator - dummynet - can be built with minimal modifications to an existing protocol stack, allowing experiments to be run on a standalone system. dummynet works by intercepting communications of the protocol layer under test and simulating the effects of finite queues, bandwidth limitations and communication delays. It runs in a fully operational system, hence allowing the use of real traffic generators and protocol implementations, while solving the problem of simulating unusual environments. With our tool, doing experiments with network protocols is as simple as running the desired set of applications on a workstation.A FreeBSD implementation of dummynet, targeted to TCP, is available from the author. This implementation is highly portable and compatible with other BSD-derived systems, and takes less than 300 lines of kernel code.},

  url = {file:///home/user/Downloads/PhD_thesis_egger_v20_corrections_for_upload.pdf},
  abstract = {Quality-of-experience (QoE) of interactive applications transmitted over TCP/IP
networks has recently gained considerable attention, and is mainly in uenced by
transmission delays due to TCP/IP's retransmission characteristic. This thesis shows
that interactive Internet applications share the commonality of a recurring request-
response cycle that is highly vulnerable to such transmission delays. In the context of
two prototypical services, interactive Internet telephony and browser based applica-
tions, the impact of transmission delays on QoE is analysed. In terms of interactive
Internet telephony, a surface structure analysis of delay impaired voice calls reveals
several changes in conversation behaviour caused by the delay. From this analy-
sis, two conversational metrics are derived that capture the in uence of delay on
human-to-human conversations. Using these metrics as additional input parame-
ters, an update to the E-Model is proposed that enhances prediction performance
considerably. For browser based applications, a novel subjective testing method-
ology is presented that establishes a realistic ow-experience in the resulting web
browsing sessions. Data from two lab studies and a ⬚eld trial proves the ability of
this test methodology to provide reliable and consistent results across di⬚erent con-
texts. In terms of the relationship between waiting time and QoE for browser based
applications, this thesis postulates the WQL hypothesis: the relationship between
"
W
aiting time and resulting
Q
oE is
L
ogarithmic". With the acquired data from
the three studies, the WQL is veri⬚ed for ⬚le downloads and simple web browsing.
Contrary, in the context of complex web browsing the WQL has to be rejected. A
following analysis reveals several challenges and practical issues that complicate the
use of the WQL for this service. Additionally, it identi⬚es the subjectively perceived
page-load-time as an interaction based measure of waiting time and promising input
parameter for novel QoE models. Finally, a human perception model, that considers
interaction quality performance aspects in the quality formation process, and that
explains (re-)actions to (conversational) input signals in the form of active output
signals is derived},

  title = {The {{QoE Provisioning-Delivery-Hysteresis}} and {{Its Importance}} for {{Service Provisioning}} in the {{Future Internet}}},
  abstract = {Quality of Experience (QoE) combines non-technical
parameters such as user perception, experience and expectations
with technical parameters such as application- and network-level
Quality of Service (QoS). For service or network providers, it
is important to understand the quantitative relationship between
QoE and these technical parameters in order to manage the userperceived
quality. This paper investigates the different impacts
of a) provisioning and b) delivery problems due to insufficient
resources on QoE, leading to the QoE provisioning-delivery
hysteresis (QoE-PDH). We demonstrate the QoE-PDH for Voiceover-
IP, live video streaming, and web browsing based on existing
measurement studies. The results clearly quantify the necessity to
control quality, instead of suffering from uncontrollable impacts
like packet loss caused by congestion. The implementation and
the limitations of the QoE-PDH in the current Internet is
shown using the example of Skype. Afterwards we discuss how
these results can be used to enhance energy-efficient service
provisioning and delivery in the Future Internet.},

At issue is the relative effect of the initial expectation level and the degree of positive or negative disconfirmation on affective judgments following product exposure. Although the results of prior studies suggest a dominant expectation effect, it is argued that detection of the disconfirmation phenomenon may have been clouded by a conceptual and methodological overdetermination problem. To test this notion, 243 college students responded to expectation and disconfirmation measures in a 3-stage field study of reactions to a recently introduced automobile model. These measures were later related to postexposure affect and intention variables in a hierarchical analysis of variance design. Although the results support earlier conclusions that level of expectation is related to postexposure judgments, it is also shown that the disconfirmation experience may have an independent and equally significant impact.},

@thesis{myakotnykh_adaptive_2008,
  title = {Adaptive {{Speech Quality}} in {{Voice}}-over-{{IP Communications}}},
  abstract = {The quality of VoIP communication relies significantly on the network that transports the voice packets because this network does not usually guarantee the available bandwidth, delay, and loss that are critical for real-time voice traffic. The solution proposed here is to manage the voice-over-IP stream dynamically, changing parameters as needed to assure quality.
The main objective of this dissertation is to develop an adaptive speech encoding system that can be applied to conventional (telephony-grade) and wideband voice communications. This comprehensive study includes the investigation and development of three key components of the system. First, to manage VoIP quality dynamically, a tool is needed to measure real-time changes in quality. The E-model, which exists for narrowband communication, is extended to a single computational technique that measures speech quality for narrowband and wideband VoIP codecs. This part of the dissertation also develops important theoretical work in the area of wideband telephony.
The second system component is a variable speech-encoding algorithm. Although VoIP performance is affected by multiple codecs and network-based factors, only three factors can be managed dynamically: voice payload size, speech compression and jitter buffer management. Using an existing adaptive jitter-buffer algorithm, voice packet-size and compression variation are studied as they affect speech quality under different network conditions. This study explains the relationships among multiple parameters as they affect speech transmission and its resulting quality.
Then, based on these two components, the third system component is a novel adaptive-rate control algorithm that establishes the interaction between a VoIP sender and receiver, and manages voice quality in real-time. Simulations demonstrate that the system provides better average voice quality than traditional VoIP.},

  abstract = {Enjoyment has been identified as a central component of the player experience (PX), but various, overlapping concepts within PX make it difficult to develop valid measures and a common understanding of game enjoyment. We conducted a systematic review of 87 quantitative studies, analyzing different operationalizations and measures of game enjoyment, its determinants, and how these were related to other components of PX, such as flow, presence and immersion. Results suggest that game enjoyment describes the positive cognitive and affective appraisal of the game experience, and may in part be associated with the support of player needs and values. Further, we outline that enjoyment is distinct from flow in that it may occur independently of challenge and cognitive involvement, and argue that enjoyment may be understood as the valence of the player experience. We conclude with a discussion of methodological challenges and point out opportunities for future research on game enjoyment.},

The effects of net-work latency have been studied, but less is known about local latency, the lag caused by input devices and displays. While local latency is important to gamers, we do not know how it affects aiming performance and whether we can reduce its negative effects. To explore these issues, we tested local latency in a variety of real-world gaming scenarios and carried out a controlled study focusing on targeting and tracking activities in an FPS game with varying degrees of local latency. In addition, we tested the ability of a lag compensation technique (based on aim assistance) to mitigate the negative effects. Our study found local latencies in the real-world range from 23 to 243 ms which cause significant and substantial degradation in performance (even for latencies as low as 41 ms). The study also showed that our compensation technique worked extremely well, reducing the problems caused by lag in the case of targeting, and removing the problem altogether in the case of tracking. Our work shows that local latency is a real and substantial problem -- but games can mitigate the problem with appropriate compensation methods.},

  title = {Logarithmic {{Laws}} in {{Service Quality Perception}}: {{Where Microeconomics Meets Psychophysics}} and {{Quality}} of {{Experience}}},
  abstract = {Utility functions, describing the value of a good or a
resource from an end user’s point of view, are widely used as an
important ingredient for all sorts of microeconomic models. In
the context of resource allocation in communication networks, a
logarithmic version of utility usually serves as the standard example
due to its simplicity and mathematical tractability. In this
paper we argue that indeed there are much more (and better)
reasons to consider logarithmic utilities as really paradigmatic, at
least when it comes to characterizing user experience with specific
telecommunication services. We justify this claim with the help
of recent results from Quality of Experience (QoE) research, and
demonstrate that, especially for Voice-over-IP and mobile
broadband scenarios, there is increasing evidence that user experience
and satisfaction follows logarithmic laws. Finally, we go
even one step further and put these results into the broader context
of the Weber-Fechner Law, a key principle in psychophysics
describing the general relationship between the magnitude of a
physical stimulus and its perceived intensity within the human
sensory system.},

  title = {Towards {{QoE Management}} for {{Scalable Video Streaming}}},
  abstract = {Video streaming applications are a major driver
for the evolution of the future Internet. In this paper we
introduce a framework for QoE management for video
streaming systems based on H.264/SVC codec, the scalable
extension of H.264/AVC. A relevant feature is to control the
user perceived quality of experience (QoE) by exploiting
parameters offered by SVC. A proper design of a control
mechanisms requires the quantification of the main influence
parameters on the QoE. For this purpose, we conducted an
extensive measurement study and quantified the influence of
i) video resolution, ii) scaling method, iii) network conditions
in terms of packet loss and iv) video content types on the
QoE by means of the SSIM and PSNR full-reference metrics.
Further, we discuss the trade-off between these different
control knobs and their influence on the QoE.},

  abstract = {Subjective quality evaluation is widely used to optimize system performance as a part of end-products. It is often desirable to know whether a certain system performance is acceptable, that is, whether the system reaches the minimum level to satisfy user expectations and needs. The goal of this paper is to examine research methods for assessing overall acceptance of quality in subjective quality evaluation methods. We conducted three experiments to develop our methodology and test its validity under heterogeneous stimuli in the context of mobile television. The first experiment examined the possibilities of using a simplified continuous assessment method for assessing overall acceptability. The second experiment explored the boundary between acceptable and unacceptable quality when the stimuli had clearly detectable differences. The third experiment compared the perceived quality impacts of small differences between the stimuli close to the threshold of acceptability. On the basis of our results, we recommend using a bidimensional retrospective measure combining acceptance and satisfaction in consumer-/user-oriented quality evaluation experiments.},

  abstract = {The purposes of this study are to construct an instrument to evaluate service
quality of mobile value-added services and have a further discussion of the
relationships among service quality, perceived value, customer satisfaction, and
post-purchase intention. Structural equation modeling and multiple regression
analysis were used to analyze the data collected from college and graduate students of
fifteen major universities in Taiwan. The main findings are as follows: (1) service
quality positively influences both perceived value and customer satisfaction; (2)
perceived value positively influences on both customer satisfaction and post-purchase
intention; (3) customer satisfaction positively influences post-purchase intention; (4)
service quality has an indirect positive influence on post-purchase intention through
customer satisfaction or perceived value; (5) among the dimensions of service quality,
“customer service and system reliability” is most influential on perceived value and
customer satisfaction, and the influence of “content quality” ranks second; (6) the
proposed model is proven with the effectiveness in explaining the relationships
among service quality, perceived value, customer satisfaction, and post-purchase
intention in mobile added-value services.},

  abstract = {There has been evidence for the very brief, temporal quantization of perceptual experience at regular intervals below 100 ms for several decades. We briefly describe how earlier studies led to the concept of “psychological moment” of between 50 and 60 ms duration. According to historical theories, within the psychological moment all events would be processed as co-temporal. More recently, a link with physiological mechanisms has been proposed, according to which the 50–60 ms psychological moment would be defined by the upper limit required by neural mechanisms to synchronize and thereby represent a snapshot of current perceptual event structure. However, our own experimental developments also identify a more fine-scaled, serialized process structure within the psychological moment. Our data suggests that not all events are processed as co-temporal within the psychological moment and instead, some are processed successively. This evidence questions the analog relationship between synchronized process and simultaneous experience and opens debate on the ontology and function of “moments” in psychological experience.},

they are defined as isolated cnvironmmts. Thus, the clwllcngc of this paper is for media
management to rethink how media evaluations slzould be rethought for the 21 sf century.},

  abstract = {The presence research community would benefit from a reliable and valid crossmedia
presence measure that allows results from different laboratories to be compared
and a more comprehensive knowledge base to be developed. The ITC-Sense
of Presence Inventory (ITC-SOPI) is a new state questionnaire measure whose development
has been informed by previous research on the determinants of presence
and current self-report measures. It focuses on users’ experiences of media,
with no reference to objective system parameters. More than 600 people completed
the ITC-SOPI following an experience with one of a range of noninteractive
and interactive media. Exploratory analysis (principal axis factoring) revealed four
factors: Sense of Physical Space, Engagement, Ecological Validity, and Negative Effects.
Relations between the factors and the consistency of the factor structure with
others reported in the literature are discussed. Preliminary analyses described here
demonstrate that the ITC-SOPI is reliable and valid, but more rigorous testing of its
psychometric properties and applicability to interactive virtual environments is required.
Subject to satisfactory confirmatory analyses, the ITC-SOPI will offer researchers
using a range of media systems a tool with which to measure four facets
of a media experience that are putatively related to presence.},

@article{sibley_combining_2007,
  title = {Combining attitudinal and transaction-specific measures in latent constructs},
  abstract = {Services are distinct from products and have characteristics that make them riskier and harder to evaluate for customers.
Research has shown that strong customer service is likely to lead to higher customer satisfaction and, presumably,
greater profits. The foremost measurement instrument for service quality is the SERVQUAL scale (Parasuraman,
Zeithaml \& Berry, 1988) which, despite criticism, has been widely used for nearly 20 years. This article examines
SERVQUAL; looks at the theoretical underpinnings regarding the relationship between service quality and customer
satisfaction; identifies an innovative, integrative solution; and posits a model to test this solution with real-world data
from the health-care services industry.
Two research hypotheses are presented; both are supported. The results are innovative for both researchers and practitioners,
as well. For researchers, these results better define – and order – the latent (that is, not directly observable)
variables service quality and customer satisfaction, bringing increased clarity. Practitioners can focus on identifying
transaction-specific programs that meet key customer needs and, by meeting or exceeding customer expectations, they
can build an attitude of customer satisfaction that should lead to more profitable business results.},

  abstract = {Digital games with realistic virtual characters have become very popular. The ability for players to promptly control their character is a crucial feature of these types of games, be it platform games, first-person shooters, or role-playing games. Delays in the responsiveness of a player's character, for example due to extensive AI calculations or to network latencies, can considerably reduce the player's enjoyment of a game. In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of the consequences of such delays on the players' experience across two games with different levels of difficulty. We investigate the effects of responsiveness on the player's experience, performance, and perception of the virtual character, as well as the player's adaptability to delays. We find that delay affects the enjoyment of the games as well as the performance, but only becomes really important when a game becomes more challenging. Furthermore, players can get used to delay within a few minutes of play, so that their performance does not significantly differ from players without a delay handicap.},

An Bewährtem wurde festgehalten: Dieses Lehrbuch ist DIE Grundlage im Bachelorstudium, denn es ist alles Prüfungsrelevante drin, von Elementarstatistik über varianzanalytische Methoden bis zu multivariaten Methoden und Übungsaufgaben helfen bei der Prüfungsvorbereitung. Es ist weiterhin auch DAS Nachschlagewerk im Masterstudium und in der Forschung: Beispiele aus dem psychologischen Forschungsalltag helfen beim Nachvollziehen von Berechnungen und ein Glossar liefert schnell die wichtigsten Begriffsdefinitionen. NEUES wurde sinnvoll ergänzt, die Didaktik optimiert: Die neue Auflage ist neu strukturiert, kürzere Kapitel sorgen für einen klareren Aufbau. Die Grundlagen werden für Einsteiger verständlicher und ausführlicher dargestellt. Markierungen kennzeichnen Vertiefungskapitel. Hinweise zu EDV-Anwendungen sind systematisch in Kästen hervorgehoben. Und besonders interessant für Anwender und die Prüfungsvorbereitung: Eine neue begleitende Website enthält Anleitungen für die Berechnung der im Buch enthaltenen Beispiele mit Statistikprogrammen (SPSS-Syntax) sowie Lerntools für Studierende und Materialien (Abbildungen und Folien) für Dozenten. Der BORTZ-SCHUSTER ist und bleibt ein unerlässliches Statistik-Lehrbuch für Studierende der Psychologie und Sozialwissenschaften, für Wissenschaftler und für Anwender},

  abstract = {In this paper, it is investigated how to efficiently apply VQ on LPC so as to realize a very low bitrate speech coder with reasonable speech coding quality. The coding bitrate has been pushed to 800 bps and the result is compared with that of a traditional LPC 2.4 kbps speech coder. In LPC10 standard(FS1015), scalar quantization is adopted to quantize the LPC parameters. However, when vector quantization is considered, the speech coding rate can be further reduced without obvious degradation of speech quality. In our coding scheme, instead of direct encoding of LPC parameters, LSF coefficients are encoded which are obtained from a transformation of LPC. In addition, in order to utilize the correlation among LPC parameters, three frames of speech are processed together so that some kind of prediction could be utilized. A weighted version of MSE is selected as the distortion measure in building the VQ codebooks and encoding. Also, due to their different characteristics, separate codebooks are built and used for voiced and unvoiced speech to better match their statistical properties. The result of our experiments shows that our 800 bps speech coding scheme can achieve similar quality to that of the LPC 2.4 kbps speech coder.},

  abstract = {Trust has shown to be an important factor both in the adoption of e-commerce but also in ongoing
relationships between buyers and sellers. Information systems literature has discussed trust
extensively, yet traditionally mostly focusing on the adoption phase. However, signs of increasing
interest to post-adoptive phenomena, such as customer loyalty, can be seen in the recent IS and ecommerce
literature. Encouraging customers to continue the relationship after the adoption has been
widely seen as vital for e-businesses. This holds especially true with B2C online services, where the
relationships are largely based on series of transactions and interactions. The paper presents a
research model in which structural assurance and online self-efficacy are viewed as the antecedents of
trust, whereas trust and switching costs are investigated as the determinants of commitment. We
empirically investigate a sample of active users of online services and use structural equation
modeling to analyze the data. The key findings are: 1. perceived structural assurance plays an
important role also after the adoption, 2. online self-efficacy was notified to be a determinant of trust,
and 3. switching costs are a determinant of commitment.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, marketers have primarily focused on keeping customers. Only recently have they
become aware that creating value by cross-selling additional services is also an important aspect of
customer relationship management. In this article we investigate how satisfaction and payment equity,
defined as the perceived fairness of the price, affect cross-buying at a multiservice provider. We also
consider its competitors’ performance on these factors. Our results show that the effect of satisfaction
differs between customers with lengthy and short relationships. It also shows that payment equity
negatively affects cross-buying for customers with long relationships. However, if the prices of the
supplier are perceived as fairer than the prices of the competitor, the customers’ probability of
cross-buying increases.},

based IS continuance theory by including constructs from the Task Technology Fit (TTF) and
Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to better understand the IS continuance intention in an
organization. It would help the managers to take decisions on the IS to make it more effective.
Based on a vast literature review, we propose an integrated model that would be an applicable
theoretical lens to explain why users continuously engage with using a system in an organization.
The proposed model consists constructs such as confirmation, perceived usefulness, tasktechnology
fit, perceived playfulness, satisfaction, subjective norm, self efficacy, controllability,
perceived behavioral control, and continuance intention. The proposed model will be used for
further empirical studies in both voluntary and mandatory settings.},

  abstract = {When individuals choose future activities on the basis of their past experiences, what guides those choices? The present study compared students' predicted, on-line, and remembered spring-break experiences, as well as the influence of these factors on students' desire to take a similar vacation in the future. Predicted and remembered experiences were both more positive—and, paradoxically, more negative—than on-line experiences. Of key importance, path analyses revealed that remembered experience, but neither on-line nor anticipated experience, directly predicted the desire to repeat the experience. These results suggest that although on-line measures may be superior to retrospective measures for approximating objective experience, retrospective measures may be superior for predicting choice.},

developed an architecture for market management; (ii) invented new business models to test and demonstrate its flexibility; (iii) implemented
generic mechanisms that not only enable these models but also many others; (iv) modelled selected features of the resulting systems and
markets and (v) conducted experiments on users to assess acceptability and the feasibility of the overall approach. Each of these aspects is

  title = {Video {{Stream Quality Impacts Viewer Behavior}}: {{Inferring Causality Using Quasi-Experimental Designs}}},
  abstract = {The distribution of videos over the Internet is drastically
transforming how media is consumed and monetized. Content
providers, such as media outlets and video subscription
services, would like to ensure that their videos do not
fail, startup quickly, and play without interruptions. In return
for their investment in video stream quality, content
providers expect less viewer abandonment, more viewer engagement,
and a greater fraction of repeat viewers, resulting
in greater revenues. The key question for a content provider
or a CDN is whether and to what extent changes in video
quality can cause changes in viewer behavior. Our work
is the first to establish a causal relationship between video
quality and viewer behavior, taking a step beyond purely
correlational studies. To establish causality, we use Quasi-
Experimental Designs, a novel technique adapted from the
medical and social sciences.
We study the impact of video stream quality on viewer
behavior in a scientific data-driven manner by using extensive
traces from Akamai’s streaming network that include
23 million views from 6.7 million unique viewers. We show
that viewers start to abandon a video if it takes more than 2
seconds to start up, with each incremental delay of 1 second
resulting in a 5.8\% increase in the abandonment rate. Further,
we show that a moderate amount of interruptions can
decrease the average play time of a viewer by a significant
amount. A viewer who experiences a rebuffer delay equal to
1\% of the video duration plays 5\% less of the video in comparison
to a similar viewer who experienced no rebuffering.
Finally, we show that a viewer who experienced failure is
2.32\% less likely to revisit the same site within a week than
a similar viewer who did not experience a failure.},

  abstract = {There is demand for subjective metrics in spoken dialogue system evaluation. SERVQUAL is a service quality evaluation method developed by marketing academics. It produces a subjective measure of the gap between expectations and perceptions in five service quality dimensions common for all services. We present how the method was applied to spoken dialogue system evaluation. In order to improve the suitability of the original method, we modified the test questionnaire and the test process. We demonstrate how the modified method was successfully used in an evaluation of a telephone-based e-mail application. The evaluation gave us directions for further development of the system. In addition, we found some interesting phenomena, such as the variation between genders. We present how the method can be further improved, for example, by dividing the questionnaire into two parts.},

  abstract = {Human perception of Voice- and Video-over-IP connection quality is influenced by a lot of factors, first of all the network conditions like packet loss rate, delay and jitter but also others like the hard- and software (speech or video codec) in use. In this paper an experimental setup is developed which allows adjustment of certain network parameters to study their impact on the perceived conversational quality. Furthermore, the new LEGOreg model conversation test scenario is proposed that motivates two test persons to engage in highly interactive conversations with balanced use of both the audio and video modalities. The setup was used in a subjective assessment of different delay times and packet loss rates. The results of the assessment, which involved 28 test persons, are presented in terms of Mean Opinion Scores (MOS).},

streams over Digital Video Broadcasting for Handhelds (DVB-H)
may contain bursty transmission errors. The bursty error
characteristics affect the end users' perceived audiovisual quality.
This study examined the perceived unacceptability of
instantaneous but noticeable audio, visual and audiovisual errors.
The erroneous streams were generated from four popular
television contents by applying three simulated error patterns with
different error rates (1.7\%, 6.9\%, 13.8\%) and error burst
durations. Instantaneous unacceptability of errors was evaluated
by 30 participants with simplified continuous assessment while
watching the program content. The results show that with the two
lowest error rates the audio errors were more unacceptable than
video errors and with the highest error rate the visual and
audiovisual errors become the most unacceptable.},

Since its original design, our system has been extended in various ways, and has become very popular in the research community due to its features and to the ability to emulate even moderately complex network setups on unmodified operating systems. We have recently made a number of extensions to the emulator, including loadable packet schedulers, support for better MAC layer modeling, the inclusion in PlanetLab, and development of Linux and Windows versions in addition to the native FreeBSD and OS X ones. The goal of this paper is to present in detail the current features of Dummynet, compare it with other emulation solutions, and discuss what operating conditions should be considered and what kind of accuracy to expect when using an emulation system.},

Two explanations for this finding are tested. Results indicate no evidence of a benefit to more‐preferred options due to the contrast to less‐preferred alternatives. However, the results of three studies suggest that retrospective global evaluations favor varied sequences that also include less‐preferred items as opposed to sequences that only include more‐preferred items, even though these more varied sequences result in diminished enjoyment during consumption.},

  abstract = {Performance factors such as quality are important in a
competitive telecommunications market where price
differentials have been minimised. An important aspect
of service performance is speech quality. Efficient
network design and service delivery is facilitated by
objective assessment of performance as perceived by
customers. Such assessment is not possible with
conventional engineering measures if the system under
test includes complex components such as data
reduction. A new generation of objective assessment
techniques is under development at BT Labs, using
models of the human senses. In this paper, the principal
applications of these techniques in intrusive and nonintrusive
quality assessment are described. Future trends
in objective quality assessinent are discussed and the
concepts of subjective testing, user expectation and
multi-sensory perceptual analysis are introduced.},
