\chapter{Multi-episodic Perceived Quality in Multiple Days}\label{chap:field}
\begin{chapter-abstract}
Here I present all studies that I conducted on multi-episodic QoE over several days.
This will include studies with one service only, but also with two services (multi-service) part.

\textit{Key question:} do field trials (longer timespan) yield similar effects as found in lab trials (chap 6).
What are the differences? (If there are any)
What services are technically feasible to deploy (or socially manageable)?
How to conduct a study over several days (lab vs. field)?

The main study will be the currently \textit{successfully} running Audio-on-demand study with BYOD.
This study is complemented by speech telephony (SIPGATE study) and QoMEX2014 study.
This chapter will also include an overview of limitations and practical knowledge for \textit{successful} field trials.

\section{Introduction}
For the investigation of multi-episodic perceived quality four experiments were conducted with duration from 7 to \unit[14]{days}.
Those experiments follow the defined-use methodology presented by \citet{moller_single-call_2011}.
The first two experiments focused on general feasibility of conducting field experiments\footnote{Here field experiment refers to an experiment conducted by the participants on their own in their "real" environment over several days, \ie, multiple sessions each with consisting of one episode.} on multi-episodic perceived quality with different services and potential issues. 

In experiment E6 only one service was used, to investigate the hypotheses \autoref{hypo:number}, \autoref{hypo:position}, and \autoref{hypo:consecutive}.
In \autoref{tab:field:experiments} the service(s) and duration per experiment is shown.

In the following first experiment E4a, E4b, and E5 are presented in detail as those form the basis for experiment E6 and E7.
Experiment E6 is, in fact, pre-experiment to E7 applying a two-party conversation task for speech telephony was used.
This, however, has been found difficult as two participants needed to solve each task together and requires a large effort of the two participants to solve the tasks together.

In all those experiments two performance only were applied, \ie, \ac{HP} and \ac{LP}.

\section{Experiment E4} %DAGA PAPER in lang + Data RECOVERY!
Experiment E4\footnote{The results of E4 are published in \citet{guse_macro-temporal_2013}.} is based upon \citet{moller_single-call_2011}.
In the later experiment it was found that the different conditions only resulted in little variation on multi-episodic judgments.
This might be either to the the limited number of degraded episodes per condition, or that applied the applied performance level for degraded episode were not severe enough.
Experiment E4 focused on two aspects: verifying the results of \citet{moller_single-call_2011} with

The speech telephony service needed to be used twice per day.
For episode a pair participants needed to solve one \ac{SCT} together.

The \ac{VoD} service needed to be used once per day in the afternoon.

\section{Experiment E6}
Experiment E6 complement the experiments on multi-episodic perceived quality in one session (\cf, \autoref{chap:lab}).
In this experiment an \ac{AoD} service only is used.
