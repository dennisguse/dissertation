Dennis Guse - Multi-episodic Perceived Quality of Telecommunication Services, 2016
===

This repository contains all publishable files of my [dissertation](https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/handle/11303/5906).

This includes:
* all Latex and [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) files,
* all [R](https://www.r-project.org/) files,
* the bibliography.
* all style-related files ([classicthesis](https://bitbucket.org/amiede/classicthesis)),
* the slides of my defense talk,
* the PDF of my submitted version, and
* the final PDFs.

This also includes the history of all files.

Please note that this repository does __not__ contain the data files (`data/data.csv` and `data/data_minimal.csv`).  
Sadly, I was not allowed to publish these, and thus this repository only contains the CSV header.  
The computational results of my modeling are intact (`data/data_modeling.csv`).

As I needed to modify the history to remove the data files, the commit-id has changed and the one noted in the final PDF (`00main.pdf`, `00main_embedded.pdf`, and `00main_embedded_pdfa.pdf`) cannot reproduced.
