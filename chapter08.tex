\chapter{Prediction of multi-episodic QoE}\label{chap:08}
\section*{Abstract}
Using data presented in previous studies, I will present here my modeling approach.
As a baseline I take the average over full history.
The approach will be analytical and not numerical, i.e. I will model effects found (hopefully all significant) and not number crunching via fancy mathematics.
This will also include modeling multi-service (for one provider) QoE.

Models I take into account are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Recency: average over limited history + linear forgetting
\item Negative Peak: weighted peak + full average
\item Positive Peak?
\item Multi-service QoE: (Service A+Service B) / 2
\end{itemize}
