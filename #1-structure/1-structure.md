# Working title: 
1. Multi-episodic subjective Quality of Telecommunication Services: Effects over Time
2. Subjective Quality of Telecommunication Services: Effects of Multi-episodic usage

## 1. Motivation, Research Question and Outline
### Research Question
How does an overall quality evolve, if a user is using a system several times / episodes / session?

Part 1: Motivation and Fundamentals
### Motivation
	Services usage, re-usage, churn etc.

### Perception, Quality and Quality of Experience, Performance, Subjective vs. Objective Quality, Different Types of Models
[WhitePaper], [QoE Book: Quality of Experiencing], [Jekosch]
	Distinction QoS (Prioritisation)
	
	Assessment methods and standards: limitations
	Subjective Measures: self-reported, physiological, behavioural (Big Data)
	Objective Measures
	Network Measurements [Hohlfeld]

### Implementation, Characteristics and Provision of telecommunication services
a) Implementation: IP (one network to rule them all); net neutrality
b) Characteristics:
	VoIP + Conferencing (optional)
	IPTV
	Video-on-demand
c) Performance impact 

### Definition of Service: The Business Perspective
	What is a service in this case?
	Definition: Service Quality
	Which parties are participating in a telecommunication service?
		service provider, customer, network provider and "business" provider
		business impact: how does the money flow and ?net neutrality? as business driver
	
	Service/Product bundles (TODO)
	
	Business impact of low performing services: churn
	Proposes measurement methods for business performance: NPS (TODO)
	
	Quality estimation needed as input for business models, however def. quality must be checked carefully.

	Acceptability, Willingness-to-pay
	
## 3. Work on Temporal Effects

### Temporal Effects in Phsychology
	Learning: Recency, Primacy
	Memory failures [Schacter]
	Opinion change due to presented evidence
	
### Temporal effects in QoE research

	Varying in call performance
	[Belmudez], [Lewcio]
	
	Call quality
	[Weiss] [ETSI]

	Video quality
	[Reiter], [Borowiak]
	
	Web quality
	[Strohmeier] [Egger]
	Discuss difference to Usability acceptance studies

	Parallel use: Attention and Importance / Preference
	
## 4. Service(s) in less than 1 hour

### One service: sequential use
	H1: The multi-episodic rating is higher the longer the distance between the rating and the ONE degraded episode (Condition 1-3)
	H2: The multi-episodic rating decreases the more episodes are degraded.
	
	Studies: Telephony and 3rd Party Listening

### Two services: alternating use

### Two services: parallel use
	Web+TV

### Aspect: only partial working system (MSc. Sebastian); web-page with missing elements / CSS

### Aspect: Importance: Task-dependency / Motivation / Goal setting (optional)
	
## 5. Service(s) over multiple days

### One Service
[Skype] [3rd party listening (tbd)]
Question 1: How do subjects remember bad experience?
Question 2: Which kind of bad experiences are remembered at all?

Gaming: over multiple days; do subjects get more sensitve?

### Two services
Question 1: Are subjects distinguishing between the two services?
Question 2: Is bundle / two-service quality just (A+B)/2?
Question 3: Is one service more important than the other?
In case of interactive (Web, Telephony, Gaming) vs. non-interactive (IPTV, VoD, AoD) 


##6. Conclusion and Outlook
