# Working title:
1. Multi-episodic Subjective Quality of Telecommunication Services: Temporal Effects
2. Subjective Quality of Telecommunication Services: Effects of Multi-episodic usage
3. Multi-episodic Perceptual Quality of Telecommunication Services

## 1. Motivation, Research Question and Outline
### Research Questions
1. How does perceptual quality evolve over multiple interactions (multiple episodes) with the one system/service for one user?
2. How does perceptual overall quality evolve over multiple interactions using a bundle, e.g. more than one system/service for one user?

Goal: Find underlying _effects_ and *create service-dependant* or *service-independent models*.

#Part 1: State-of-the-Art		
## Chapter 2: On Perceptual Quality [WhitePaper, QoE Book Chap 2, Jekosch, Blauert, Moeller]

###Perceptual Quality
    - Definition of performance
    (Physical) Event: An obervable occurance with time, location, character [Whitepaper].
    -> Duration? [me]
    
    Perceptual Event (with Sensory Processing [QoE Book Chap 2]): A physical event may(!) trigger a perceptual event.
    -> When does a physical event trigger a perceptual event? (Attention?, Focus?)
    -> Behavioral impact of perceptual events: _anticipation and matching_ and _explorative actions_ [QoE Book Chap 2]
    
    Experience: An experience is an individual's stream of perception and interpretation of one or multiple events [Whitepaper].
    (Perceptual) Quality: Individual comparison and judgment process with perception, reflection (optional?) and description of the outcome (optional?) [Whitepaper]
      [Jekosch, Raake, Whitepaper]
    
    Expectations: [REF?]
    - Prior experiences
    - Desired nature

    Perceptual Quality Features, Quality Elements, Perceptual dimensions [Moeller, Raake]

    Quality as hygenic factor [Moeller, Wechsung]

    Semiotic triangle [Raake, Buch p.2]

    Contextual factors, Task, Acceptance
    Utility [Kahnemann]

    Open questions:
    - How do experience and perceptual event come together?
      Is an experience a perceptual event?

    
###Memorization: Encoding and Retrieval of episodes
    Episode [Tulving, Black+Bower, Ezzyat]:
    - Colloquial:  http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/episode (an event that is distinctive and separate although part of a larger series)
    - remembering vs. knowledge [Tulving]

    - Episodic memory "temporally dated episodes or events and temporal-spatial relations" [Tulving p.385]
    - "A perceptual event _can_ be stored in the episodic system solely in terms of its perceptible properties [Tulving p.385]
    - Experienced events have a temporal order (Retrieval should also reveal this order!) [Tulving]

    - autobiographical reference, personal identiy [Tulving p.10], [Conway]
    -> What? When? Where? Situation+Feelings [Tulving p.10]
    - Explicit start and end [Conway]
    - Time-travel (I must be able to travel back to that situation); memory-vivedness [Conway]
      
    - Successful retrieval requires succesful encoding! (successful retrieval: a person can describe perceptual properties AND temporal relations to other events)

    - Events are part of an episode.
    -> Providing a cue for one episodes allows to retrieve information this episode alone!
    
    Event segmentation theory (EST) [Black+Bower, Ezzyat, Zacks]
    - by goal [Black+Bower]
    - temporal closeness [Black+Bower, Ezzyat p.248]
    - "that segments experience (events) into episodes" [Ezzyat p.248]
    - event segmentation happens while experiencing [Ezzyat p.248]

    - [Conway] following [Barsalou 1988] Event-specific knowledge (ESK)
    -> general "events": repeated events (e.g. evening hikes) and single events (trip to Paris)
    -> Series of memories linked to together by a theme
    -> Goal-attainment knowledege
    --- First encounter (better encoded->more important AND seems to set expectations)
    --- Repeated encouter
    
    - Memory failures [Schacter?]
    -> Failure to recall due encoding
    -> Failure to recall due to retrievability
    -> Mis-attribution

###Quality assessment
  Quality formation process [Raake, QoE Book Chap.2]

  Quality perspectives [QoE Book, UX Whitepaper :(]:
  - Momentary
  - Retrospective (with/out duration)
  - Multi-episodic
  
  Note: Not everything is an episode: a 8s speech stimuli is not an episode (unlikely to be encoded as episode in episodic memory)
  Anyhow, assessment is done in retrospect (after listening to the simulus).
  
  (Definition) _Episodic Perceptual Quality_: 
    Retrospective perceptual quality evaluation _after_ completion of one or more interactions that is _likely_ with one system/application/service to be memorized as episode.
    -> Spatio-temporal boundaries AND goal!
    Example: A full-length movie.
    Example: A phone call.
    Example: A browsing session.
    
    Note: An episode _might_ consists of several interactions, e.g. pause watching a movie for an incoming phone call and continuing afterwards.
    Note: It is not required that an _episode_ can be recalled - it must only fulfill the requirements that it _can_ be encoded in episodic memory.

  Definition: Multi-episodic Quality
    Retrospective perceptual quality evaluation _after_ multiple usage episodes with the _same_ system/application/service.
    Note: Recall of each individual episodic quality is _not_ required.
    
    Question: Using Skype on a mobile vs. fixed access to be integrated into the _same multi-episodic quality_?

##Chapter 3: Implementation, Characteristics and Provision of IP-based Telecommunication services
How do IP-based telecommunication services work?
- VoIP [Raake]
- Video [Neige-Garcia]
- Web []

##Chapter 4: Time as aspect of experience

###TODO
  Utility [Kahnemann]
  Happiness [Kahnemann]
  Learning

  Importance of content [Baumgartner]: Ads and _positive_ peak effect on remembering content

  Definition Effects:
  - Recency
  - Duration neglect [Kahnemann, Frederickson]
  - Peak
  - Peak-end effect
  
  Belief-Adjustment Model [Hogarth]

	Memory failures [Schacter]

	
	(optional) Adjustment-level Theory


###Time and perceptual quality
Assumption: Temporal perception AND memorization comparable over persons.

####Performance fluctuations as part of an episode
  -> Temporal fluctuations in one _short_ stimulus
  
  TODO: Not long enough - much more related work required.
  
	VoIP: Packet-loss [Raake, Waeltermann, Cote]
	VoIP: Call-quality	[Lewcio, Belmudez, Berger]
	Video quality [???]
	Web quality	[Strohmeier, Egger, Sackl]

####Performance fluctuations in episodes
  Assessment methods, Tasks?
  
	Call [Weiss, ETSI 102206, Rosenbluth], Gros+Chateau]
	Video [Reiter, Borowiak, Staelens]
	Video telephony [Schoenenberg?]
	Web [Hossfeld, Egger, Sackl, Strohmeier]

	Distraction [Guse]: 2nd task with 2nd system
	-> Attention and Importance / Preference

####Modelling temporal effects
  Baseline: averaging model (in line with Belief-Update-Model)
  
  Temporal pooling
  

#Part 2: On Multi-episodic Perceptual Quality

Overview: Multi-episodic, multi-service diagram

##Chapter 5: Prior work
  - Average phone call [Duncanson]
  - Assessment method [Moeller Skype]

##Chapter 5: Multi-episodic quality in 1 hour

###Sequential use
  - One system:  repeated usage
  -> Number of degraded episodes.
  -> Recency?
  -> Recovery
  -> Type of task (conversation vs. listening)
  - Impact of 2nd service on multi-episodic

### Parallel-use
  Study Web+TV, e.g. distraction


##Chapter 6: Multi-episodic quality over multiple days

  -> Research Question: How do subjects integrate low episodic quality into an overall experience?

  - [Skype]
  - XoD
  - VoIP + AoD
  - [3rd party listening (tbd)]
  - Telephony field

  Gaming: over multiple days; do subjects get more sensitve?

  ###Limitations of field studies

##Chapter 7: Multi-episodic quality of multiple services
  - XoD
  - VoIP + VoD
  
  Question 1: Are subjects distinguishing between the two services?
  Question 2: Is bundle / two-service quality just (A+B)/2?
  Question 3: Is one service more important than the other?

##Chapter 8: Conclusion and Outlook
  - Service retainability?
  - Task importance (impact on memorizing, i.e. encoding)?
  - What happens with a positive peak (better performance tha usual)?
