\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
During my time working on my dissertation, I had the pleasure to meet, work, and getting to know a large number of awesome persons.

I would like to thank my supervisor Prof.~Dr\=/Ing.~Sebastian Möller for providing me the opportunity to pursue my doctoral degree.
Also, I would like to thank Prof.~Dr.~Judith Redi and Prof.~Dr.\=/Ing.~Ulrich Reiter for serving on my doctoral committee.
Also, I am grateful that I had the opportunity to work closely with Dr.~Benjamin Weiss, who provided important feedback, near-endless discussions, and his steady support.
The same holds for Prof.~Dr\=/Ing.~Alexander Raake.

My deepest thanks goes to my colleagues Anna Wunderlich and Frank Haase.
Without their impressive work, their clever ideas, and their precise preparation, the conducted experiments and thus this dissertation would have been impossible.
It felt like pure luxury working with them.
Thanks also to Henrique~R.~Orefice for the opportunity to build an awesome software project.

I would also thank my colleagues and friends Friedemann Köster, Falk Schiffner, Steffen Zander, Janto Skowronek, Dr.~Hagen Wierstorff, Dr.\=/Ing.~Sebastian Arndt, Johannes Rummel, Dr.~Oliver Hohlfeld, and Prof.~Dr.\=/Ing.~Jens Ahrens for introducing me to interesting topics, helped working on fancy research projects, and, most important, cheering me up.
Especially, the near-infinite number of table soccer games and the impressive niveau have been very important to me.

Last but not least, I am grateful to my girlfriend Regine Hähnel.
Without her energetic, continuous support, I would not finished my dissertation
I am so glad, she endured all the stressful times and helped enthusiastically.
