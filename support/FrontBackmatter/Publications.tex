\subsection*{}
In \citep{guse_macro-temporal_2013} and \citep{guse_modelling_2014} the main work was done by myself.
This includes experimental design, conducting the experiments, analyzing the data, and writing the publications.
Please note, that in \citep{guse_modelling_2014} also experimental data from \citep{moller_single-call_2011}, an experiment in which I was not involved, was used to evaluate prediction models.
My colleague Dr.~Benjamin~Weiss and Prof.~Dr.-Ing.~Sebastian Möller, my first supervisor, were involved in discussing the experimental design, data analysis, interpreting the results, and also follow-up work.

In \citep{weiss_temporal_2014}, I have written the section "10.5~Assessing Multi-Episodic QoE"~(p.~142ff.).
This work was possible due to the intensive discussions with Dr.~Benjamin~Weiss, Prof.~Dr.-Ing.~Sebastian Möller, and Prof.~Dr.-Ing.~Alexander~Raake, who provided valuable feedback.
