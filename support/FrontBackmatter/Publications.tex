\subsection*{}
In \citet{guse_macro-temporal_2013} and \citet{guse_modelling_2014} the main work was done by myself.
This includes designing the experiments, setting up required technical systems, conducting the experiments, analyzing the data, and writing the publications.
Please note that in \citet{guse_modelling_2014} also experimental data from \citet{moller_single-call_2011}, an experiment in which I was not involved, was used to develop and evaluate prediction models for multi-episodic judgments.
My colleague Dr.~Benjamin~Weiss and Prof.~Dr.-Ing.~Sebastian Möller, my first supervisor, were involved in discussing the experimental designs, conducting data analysis, interpreting the results, and designing potential prediction models.

In \citet{weiss_temporal_2014}, I have written the section \emph{10.5~Assessing Multi-Episodic QoE}~(p.\,142ff.).
This work was possible due to the intensive discussions with Dr.~Benjamin~Weiss, Prof.~Dr.-Ing.~Sebastian Möller, and Prof.~Dr.-Ing.~Alexander Raake, who all provided valuable feedback.
