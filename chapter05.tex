\chapter{State-of-the-art of Multi-episodic QoE (or Perception?)}\label{chap:05} %state-of-the-art? QoE might be too limiting as we also include usability
\begin{chapter-abstract}
%NOTE: This chapter might be too small, consider merging with previous chapter.

Here I present the state-of-the-art on multi-episodic QoE (Moeller2011, Duncanson1969, Guse2013?.
Here it is important to state again the research question (How do subjects integrate low episodic quality into an overall experience?) for this domain and introduce methodologies.
Major point here is the research method (task-driven, defined usage behavior, limited freedom in usage behavior).

In the second part I give an overview from the usability perspective with regard to adaption of behavior over time (long-term / multi-episodic QoE).
At the end of this chapter I must have made clear what methodologies are used and also made clear what their respective target is.

%Hint here practical limitations (setup, for test subjects).
%Duncanson actually did not multi-episodic QoE but rather \textit{expected average QoE}.
%Moeller2011 developed and a applied a research methodology for multi-episodic QoE, but results were limited: low performance episode did not statistically affect multi-episodic QoE.
%Duncanson: looked actually not into multi-episodic QoE, but rather what influences the expected average system performance?
%Results: low performance is bad.

\section{Assessment Methods for Multi-episodic QoE}
%TODO: Discuss here potential methods for multi-episodic QoE and highlight that either a really large amount of people is necessary OR "freedom" of test subjects needs to be limited.

\section{Moeller 2011}
Moeller (Skype): First conducted multi-episodic QoE study.
Major Result: methodology can be applied, episodic quality judgments show that performance could be provided with the used system.
Minor Results2: 
\begin{itemize}
\item increase of episodic QoE judgments over time? (significant)
\item conditions did not yield significant different multi-episodic QoE, but at least consistent
%TODO Critize study as the performance cannot be replicated, no recordings
%Limitation: no "training" and no supervised usage(?) 
%NO imposter detection!, very expansive
\end{itemize}
\section{Guse 2013}
%Guse2013 (following Moeller) found a relative slow adaptation of multi-episodic QoE.
%The two data sets cannot be used alone for modeling multi-episodic QoE.
