\chapter{State-of-the-art on Multi-episodic QoE}\label{chap:05}
\section*{Abstract}
Here I present the state-of-the-art on multi-episodic QoE.
From a QoE perspective this will be Duncanson and the Skype-Paper.
Here it is important to state again the research question (How do subjects integrate low episodic quality into an overall experience?)for this domain and introduce methodologies.
In the second part I give an overview from the usability perspective with regard to adaption of behavior over time (long-term / multi-episodic QoE).
At the end of this chapter I must have made clear what methodologies were used and also made clear what their respective target is.
