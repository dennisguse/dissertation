\chapter{Multi-episodic QoE over multiple days}\label{chap:07}
\section*{Abstract}
Here I present all studies that I conducted on multi-episodic QoE over several days.
This will include studies with one service only, but also with two services (multi-service) part.
This chapter will also include an overview of limitations and practical knowledge for successful field trials.

Important

\begin{itemize}
%\item Jitsi + Silverlight (DAGA)
\item CSipSimple + Silverlight
\item AoD + VoD (QoMEX)
\item SIPGate Telephony
\item Field AoD: to be evaluated
\item (Sabrina, Gaming): over multiple days; do subjects get more delay sensitve?
\end{itemize}

\section{On practical aspects of Field Studies}

\begin{itemize}
\item Production Ready Systems
\item Temporal Constraint
\item "Real" environment (subject's own context)\textsl{â€¢}
\item Cheater detection for consumption only
\end{itemize}

\section{Multi-episodic QoE with one service}

%TODO are there cross-service effects?

Finish this section with a comparison to laboratory studies?

%\section{Excurse: on retaining information}
%Can subjects recall
