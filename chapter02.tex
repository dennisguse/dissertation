\chapter{Quality of Experience}

\section*{Summary}
Here I give an overview on the concept of Perceptual Quality.
This is basically Moeller, Jekosch, Psychophysics as well as Raake.
I should here include also some technical examples why QoE is important for IP-based networks.

\begin{itemize}
\item Definition of performance
\item (Physical) Event: An obervable occurance with time, location, character [Whitepaper].
\item    -> Duration? [me]
    
\item Perceptual Event (with Sensory Processing [QoE Book Chap 2]): A physical event may(!) trigger a perceptual event.
\item -> When does a physical event trigger a perceptual event? (Attention?, Focus?)
\item -> Behavioral impact of perceptual events: anticipation and matching and explorative actions [QoE Book Chap 2]
    
\item Experience: An experience is an individual's stream of perception and interpretation of one or multiple events [Whitepaper].
\item (Perceptual) Quality: Individual comparison and judgment process with perception, reflection (optional?) and description of the outcome (optional?) [Whitepaper]
\item [Jekosch, Raake, Whitepaper]
    
\item Expectations: [REF?]
\item - Prior experiences
\item - Desired nature
\item - Internal reference

\item Perceptual Quality Features, Quality Elements, Perceptual dimensions [Moeller, Raake]
\item Quality as hygenic factor [Moeller, Wechsung]

\item Semiotic triangle [Raake, Buch p.2]

\item Contextual factors, Task, Acceptance
\item Relatedness to Utility [Kahnemann]

\item Open questions: How do experience and perceptual event come together? Is an experience a perceptual event?

Here I give an overview on the concept of QoE.
This is basically Moeller, Jekosch, Psychophysics as well as Raake.

What makes this field special compared?

\begin{itemize}
\item What does this concept include?
\item What are related concepts: QoS, Performance?
\item What is expericening? (cite book)
\item What is perception?
\item What is psychophysics?
\item What leads to an experience? Perceptual event etc.

\item How is this studied? How is QoE typically assessed? (Methods)?

\item Practical outcome?
\item Definitions: QoE, QoS
\item Expectations? 

\item Contextual factors
\item Desired Nature
\item Acceptance

\item Types of judgment: momentary and retrospective
\item Quality formation process

\item Practical outcome: objective assessment and 

\item ARCU + Geerts
\item performance fluctuations
\end{itemize}
