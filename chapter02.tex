\chapter{Quality of Experience}\label{chap:02}
\begin{chapter-abstract}
Here I give an overview on the concept of \ac{QoE}.
This is basically Psychophysics (Perception): Blauert, Moeller, Jekosch and Raake.
I present standard assessment methods (\ac{ACR}, \ac{MUSHRA} etc.)and the underlying/implicit assumption for user studies).
However, the main focus on \textit{higher level} concepts (Moeller, ARCU and Geerts), which propose a more holistic approach towards \ac{QoE} and consider time and repeated usage.
At the end I will discuss, how \ac{QoE} relates to concepts of Utility, Acceptability, Satisfaction and Service Quality (needed in chap 4).
Those concept are important from the business perspective.

I should here include also some technical examples why \ac{QoE} is important for \ac{IP}-based networks.
Specialized methods for assessment of temporal effects / performance fluctuations are presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:04}.

\section{Perception and Psychophysics}
%\item What is perception?
%\item What is psychophysics? Where does it come from?
Human use their senses, \ie perceptual organs, to perceive the events of their environment.
Based upon perceived events an internal model is created and updated, which incorporates knowledge about the environment and thus reality.
This model is then used to plan actions and updated, when new information including perceptual events are processed.
%\cite[p. 4]{blauert_spatial_1996}: "Auditory events, at first relatively diffuse in their locatedness, become more precisely defined spatially; the correspondence to the visual world and to other senses also become more precise."

%\item Perceptual Event (with Sensory Processing [QoE Book Chap 2]): A physical event may(!) trigger a
%\item (Physical) Event: An observable occurrence with time, location, character [Whitepaper] -> Duration? [me]
A \emph{perceptual event} occurs in a human observer occurs, when a \emph{physical event} stimulates a sensory organ~\cite{blauert_spatial_1996}.
A physical event is an observable occurrence in time, location and character~\cite{callet_qualinet_2013}.
One example of a physical event is a sound event that reaches the ear results in an auditory event in the observer (see ~\ref{img:chap02:auditory-event}).
Because the perceptual event occurs inside the observer, also due to perceptual and mental processing, it cannot observed directly.
A perceptual event can only be described by the observer by comparing the perception to other known features and express it.

%\item Definition of physical observable things may lead to perception AND may be memorized.
By measuring the properties of a physical event and relating those measurements to the description of the perceptual events psychometric functions can be derived.
%\item Inherent assumption: perception is more or less reproducible: humans perceive similar
The description of a physical event and their perception must not necessarily be identical for different observers as each observer describes his individual perceptual event~\cite[p. 11]{blauert_spatial_1996}.
A psychophysical experiment is considered \emph{objective}, if the results are reproducible, independent if one subject is measured repeatedly or multiple subjects are used, \ie the system is ergodic~\cite[p. 11]{blauert_spatial_1996}.

A physical event, also if it is not consciously results in a perceptual event, may change the internal state of an observer.
The physical event reaching the sensory organ can affect the sensitivity to following physical events.
For example a bright light consumes the amount of chemicals in the eye and thus directly following physical events consisting of light will be perceived differently by the eye.
With regard to physical events that can be perceived by the human ear similar effects occurs.
Here a sound wave reaching the one ear affects the ear nerve cells behavior and thus the perception of following sound waves changes. %Add sentence about 4ms adaption of ear cells stuff (REF)
%TODO Cocktailparty effect
That the perception of a physical event depends actually on previous physical events has already been observed by Weber~\cite{Weber-Fechner} leading to the notion \ac{JND} for the perceptability of physical changes.
The perception of different physical events is not only affected by the temporal order, but temporal close physical events may grouped together and form one perceptual event.%TODO REF
This perceptual event can then not split directly into the physical events by the observer.

Not only changes in the sensory organs affect perception of physical events.
One example for this is the so-called \emph{cocktail party effect} showing how focus affect perception.
This denotes the fact that a person can actively focus on a sound source and filter additional sound source that are not in the focus.
This allows a person to listen to one speaker in a room with several parallel speakers.

A psychophysical experiment is conducted by presenting one or more physical events as stimuli to one or more observers.
Each individual observer derives the description of his perceptual event by translating it to XXX. %TODO
The description can be expressed in a quantitative form by selecting the best fitting answer from a pre-defined set or in a free form.
Whereas in the first case the encoding is conducted by an observer himself, in the latter case the encoding open by the observer.
The description task requires that the perceptual event can be observed consciously and the observation process affects perception.
Physical events that lead to perceptual event that cannot be observed consciously cannot be studied using this method of active reflection.
The (subconscious) reaction of an observer due to a physical event, however, can be measured by using physiological measurements like skin conductance.
By applying \ac{EEG}, in fact, also parts of the subconscious perceptual process might be observable.

%\item What is experiencing? (cite book)
\begin{definition}[Experiencing]
``is the individual stream of perceptions (of feelings, sensory percepts and concepts) that occurs in a particular situation of reference.''~\citep[p. 13]{moller_quality_2014}.
\end{definition}


\begin{itemize}
\item (Perceptual) Quality: Individual comparison and judgment process with perception, reflection (optional?) and description of the outcome (optional?) [whitepaper]
\item Quality formation process
\item Assumed quality + recalled quality
\item Expectations: Prior experiences, Desired nature, Internal reference, Contextual Factors, Task [Moeller, Raake] 
\item Perceptual Quality Features, Quality Elements, Perceptual dimensions [Moeller, Raake]%NOTE: Features only very short!
%NOPE \item Semiotic triangle [Raake, Buch p.2]: sign carrier, referent and meaning; (is similar to Shannon)
\item What are related concepts: QoS, Performance?
\item Check Geerts for broader context!
\item Moeller DISS taxonomy
\item REF Gaming taxonomy, if used later!
\item Lab vs. field studies

\begin{definition}[\acf{QoE}]
``is the degree of delight or annoyance of a person whose experiencing involves an application, service, or system. It results from the person’s evaluation of the fulfillment of his or her expectations and needs with respect to the utility and / or enjoyment in the light of the person’s context, personality and current state.''~\citep[p. 21]{moller_quality_2014}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Assumed quality]
``corresponds to the quality and quality features that users, developers, manufacturers or  service  providers assume regarding a  system, service or product that they intend to be using, or will be producing, without however grounding these assumptions on an explicit assessment of \textit{quality based on experiencing}.''~\citep[p. 20]{moller_quality_2014}.
