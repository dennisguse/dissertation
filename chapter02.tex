\section{Perceptual Quality}
\subsection{Perception and Psychophysics}
Human use their senses, \ie, perceptual organs, to perceive events of their environment.
Based upon those events, an internal model is created and updated, which incorporates knowledge about the environment.
%This model is used to plan actions and updated when new information, including perceptual events, are processed~\citep[p.~4]{blauert_spatial_1996}.
A \emph{perceptual event} occurs in a human observer, when a \emph{physical event} stimulates a sensory organ~\citep[p.~5]{blauert_spatial_1996}.
A physical event is an observable occurrence in time, location and character~\citep{callet_qualinet_2013}.
%One example of a physical event is a sound event that reaches the ear results in an auditory event in the observer (see \autoref{img:chap02:auditory-event}).
A perceptual event cannot be observed directly, because it occurs inside the observer due to perceptual and mental processing.
It can, however, be described by the observer.
The description process requires that a perceptual event can be observed consciously.
In addition, a perceptual event can also be observed indirectly with behavioral measurements and physiological measurements.
In fact, these measurements might be considered a special form of description.
A psychometric function can be derived by measuring the properties of physical events and relating those to the description.

A psychophysical experiment is conducted by presenting one or more physical events as stimuli to one or more observers.
Each individual observer derives the description of his perceptual event.
A description can be expressed in a quantitative form, by selecting the best fitting answer from a predefined set, or in a free form.
For different observers the description the perceptual event resulting from a physical event must not necessarily be identical.
In fact, each observer describes his individual perceptual event with regard to his concepts~\citep[p.~11]{blauert_spatial_1996}.
%A psychophysical experiment is considered \emph{objective}, if the results are reproducible independent if one observer is measured or multiple observers~\citep[p. 11]{blauert_spatial_1996}.

The perception of a physical event may change the internal state of an observer \citep{raake_quality_2014}.
A physical event reaching the sensory organ can affect the sensitivity of this organ, or the observer might react to a physical event.
Thus, the perception of following physical events might be affected.
Also, the description of successive stimuli might be affected by presentation order, because previous stimuli can be used as reference.
%The perception of different physical events is not only affected by the temporal order, but temporal close physical events may be grouped together and form one perceptual event.
Beside this, also the \emph{active} observation might affect the perceptual process \citep[][p.~30]{raake_quality_2014}.
Here, an observer might focus his attention on the perception to derive a description of a perceptual event.
This might actually influence resulting perceptual events and thus the description.


\subsection{Perceptual Quality and Formation Process}\label{related:perceivedQuality}
Perceptual quality is a branch of psychophysics focusing on the experience due to perception and the resulting quality of this experience.
\begin{definition}[Experiencing]
``is the individual stream of perceptions (of feelings, sensory percepts and concepts) that occurs in a particular situation of reference.''~\citep[p.~13]{raake_quality_2014}.
\end{definition}

With regard to the quality of an experience and the underlying perceptual events, \citet{jekosch_voice_2005} formulates the \emph{quality formation process} as an individual comparison process between the desired, or expected, outcome with the experienced outcome.
The comparison of expectations and the actual experience results in the observer in a \emph{quality event}.
%This complements the description of a perceptual event by an additional quality evaluation process.
%This process is shown in \autoref{img:chap02:quality-event}.

%\end{figure}
It is assumed that a perceptual event is evaluated by a \emph{comparing system} within an observer.
This system  derives the \emph{quality features} of this event~\citep[\cf,][p.~17]{jekosch_voice_2005}.\footnote{\citet{jekosch_voice_2005} uses the term \emph{entity} with regard to the quality formation process.
As entity does not convey a temporal component, the term \emph{event} is in this work used instead; following the notion of \citet{blauert_spatial_1996}.}

\begin{definition}[Quality Feature]
``is a recognized and designated characteristic of an entity that is relevant to the entity's quality.''~\citep[][p.~17]{jekosch_voice_2005}
\end{definition}

It is assumed that the evaluation of the difference between the \emph{perceived quality features} and the \emph{desired quality features} result in the experienced quality~\citep[p.~23]{raake_quality_2014}.
With regard to telecommunication services and multimedia systems, the term \emph{perceived quality} has been extended to \acf{QoE}.
In \ac{QoE} an observer is not regarded as a measurement instrument, but as an actor striving for a \emph{satisfying} perceived quality with regard to his expectations, requirements and needs.
In difference to an observer, who only describes an event, an actor can proactively make decisions and react to his environment.  

\begin{definition}[\acf{QoE}]
``is the degree of delight or annoyance of a person whose experiencing involves an application, service, or system.
It results from the person’s evaluation of the fulfillment of his or her expectations and needs with respect to the utility and / or enjoyment in the light of the person’s context, personality and current state.''~\citep[][p.~19]{raake_quality_2014}
\end{definition}

\citet{raake_quality_2014} extended the \emph{quality formation process} of \citet{jekosch_voice_2005}.
Here, an anticipation process and update process are added.
These processes incorporate current experiences into expectations and might change the desired quality features.
Thus, following perceived quality of following experiences might be changed.
In addition, the concept of \emph{assumed quality} is derived.
\begin{definition}[Assumed Quality]\label{def:assumedquality}
``corresponds to the quality and quality features that users, developers, manufacturers or service providers assume regarding a system, service or product that they intend to be using, or will be producing, without however grounding these assumptions on an explicit assessment of \textit{quality based on experiencing}.''~\citep[][p.~17]{raake_quality_2014}.
\end{definition}
Here, the experience has not yet taken place, but the quality formation process is based on expectations and prior knowledge.
Based upon \emph{assumed quality} a user might decide to initiate an interaction or rather avoid it.

The actual experience and resulting perceived quality is affected by influence factors.
\begin{definition}[Influence Factor]
``Any characteristic of a user, system, service, application, or context whose actual state or setting may have influence on the \ac{QoE} for the user.''~\citep[][p.~56]{reiter_quality_2014}
\end{definition}
Contextual factors, which include task, user behavior, and usage situation~\citep[][p.~56]{reiter_quality_2014}, are important as those are often not invariant.
For example, high delay might not be noticed in a two-party telephone conversation, if only one speaker is talking.
It thus not perceived as degradation and does not affect the quality formation process. %TODO REF

The formation process of perceived quality is still under investigation, because it is not yet fully understood. %TODO REF
In fact, assessment methods for perceived quality and the broader concept of \ac{QoE} are still under development.

\subsection{Assessment Methods}
For the assessment of perceived quality, experiments are conducted that allow an actor to experience a service.
Information about the quality of the experience can be derived by monitoring the actor, observing his behavior, or requesting to describe his experience.

For a quantitative description often scales with predefined labels are used.
An actor describes his experience by selecting the label that closest characterizes his perceived quality.
The labels act as anchors, so multiple judgments of the same or different stimuli can be related with each other.
Examples of such scales are \acf{ACR} scales and \acf{CCR} scales.
In the latter case, also judgments between two labels can be expressed.
%Most common is the 5-point \ac{ACR} ranging from \emph{Bad (1)} to \emph{Excellent (5)}. %\footnote{This scale is often denoted as \ac{MOS} scale. This however is not correct as the \ac{MOS} is rather the combination of multiple judgments by one or more actors into one score by calculating the arithmetic mean.}
%Note that the term stimulus is misleading as it suggests an observer rather than an actor, which in some cases might be correct but not in general.

Based upon the judgments, a \acf{MOS} can be derived by averaging of all judgments per stimuli \citep{itu-t_p.800.2:_2013}.
The \ac{MOS} is assumed to reflect the judgment of an \emph{average actor} for this stimuli and the resulting experience.
Judgments of an experience can either be taken while experiencing, which are denoted as \emph{momentary judgments}, or after an experience.
Taking momentary judgments might affect the perceptual process, because the assessment task must be conducted in parallel. %TODO REF
However, momentary judgments allow to investigate the impact of varying performance in a stimuli.
This allows to investigated especially noticeability of varying performance.
Assessing the perceived quality of an experience after this experience is denoted as \emph{retrospective judgment}~\citep[][]{weiss_temporal_2014}.
A retrospective judgment is based upon recallable characteristics of an experience.
It has been observed that not all parts of one experience affect a retrospective judgment in a similar manner (\cf, \autoref{chap:04}).
%For the investigation of the impact of small differences between stimuli often paired comparison methodologies are applied, which present multiple stimuli and request to judge them with regard to each other or select the \emph{better} one.

It must be noted that a judgment cannot be considered as absolute in terms of universal, because it is the result of the quality formation process and description process.
These processes are affected by differences in the so-called internal reference, which might lead to biases \citep[][]{zielinski_biases_2008, pitrey_aligning_2011}.
For example narrowband speech stimuli are judged better, if no wideband stimuli are presented \citep[][]{koster_comparison_2015}.

\subsection{Prediction of Perceived Quality}
Beyond understanding the underlying processes in detail, one major goal of research on \ac{QoE} is the algorithmic prediction of judgments.
This is especially important as the evaluation by human actors is an expensive procedure and thus limits the number of evaluations.
In addition, continuous evaluation, as required for network monitoring, is not feasible in this manner.

An algorithmic predictor is called a \emph{model}.
A model maps the input, often a stimulus or an abstract reduced presentation of a stimulus, to an expected judgment.
The necessary information to create a model can be derived with subjective experiments, \ie, selecting \emph{representative} stimuli and let participants judge the perceived quality.
A model can be applied for automatic evaluation, which is for example useful for development of new lossy coding algorithms.
Especially for telecommunication services models have been developed for planning purposes, \eg, \emph{E-Model} \citep{itu-t_g.107:_2015}.

%For the prediction of speech transmission and occurring degradations models have been developed 
%For speech transmission \ac{POLQA} \citep{itu-t_p.863:_2014} and \emph{E-Model} \citep{itu-t_g.107:_2015} are widely used examples.
%Where as the former predicts perceived quality based upon the difference between input signal and output signal, the latter uses only a parametric, reduced representation.
%Depending on the purpose of a model, different input and outputs are desired.
%Input might also include beside technical performance-related characteristics, information about the influence factors.

In fact, a model is inherently limited by underlying data, which lead to the selection of the model's parts and parameters.
A model must be carefully applied to the implied restrictions resulting from the limited data.
Using it outside its designed scope, might result in invalid predictions.
