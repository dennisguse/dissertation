\chapter{Discussion and Conclusion}\label{chap:09}
\begin{chapter-abstract}
In this chapter I will give an overview of my conducted research.
I will start with the research question and my approach.
Then I will outline the key facts of my work and very important lessons learned (how to conduct a field study).
Here I will also criticize my work (especially study methodology and the included limitations).
The outlook will include three distinct research directions for follow-up PhDs.

Highlight that reproducible research is very important, because multi-episodic QoE studies are very expensive AND an added value can only be achieved if enough data is available.
\end{chapter-abstract}

\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Task importance; service failure (task not solvable)
\item Verify determining factors for episodic QoE? Can an episode be split (solve a task later due to failure?);
\item Not triggering episodic evaluation?
\item Multi-episodic QoE with one service, but different access paths? (like Skype on mobile vs. Skype on fixed access)

\item Analyze business impact: reference to Miguel's work.
\end{itemize}
