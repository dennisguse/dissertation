\section{Retrospective Judgments of Experiences}\label{chap:03}
For a retrospective judgment of an experience, a person can only rely on information available to him.
While experiencing, a person needs to encode and memorize information in order to recall this information for a later judgment.
Already during perception the amount of information is reduced, because only subset of information can be encoded successfully into the into the perceptional memory and afterwards into the working memory \citep[][p.\,8f.]{raake_speech_2006}.
While those types of memory have only very limited storage time, in the range of seconds up to minutes, the information that becomes encoded into the long-term memory may remain accessible for several years.
Memorized information decays, reducing the amount of \emph{original} information even further.
In addition, recall from long-term memory is not a perfect process.
On recall, the original information is complemented by additional, potentially unrelated, information \citep[\cf,][]{schacter_seven_2003}.
In fact, other information might even prevent the recall of specific information \citep[\cf,][]{schacter_seven_2003}.
Here, prior knowledge and also prior experiences affect the actual recalled information.
%In fact, specific information might not be accessible at all at the time of recall.

Two aspects are important with regard to experiences and their retrospective judgments.
First, how are experiences stored and in which manner is the information about individual experiences grouped together?
Second, what effects/biases determine retrospective judgments of an episodic experience?
Based upon the concept of episodic memory, this leads to the definition of the \emph{usage episode} that forms the basis for my work on multi\-/episodic perceived quality.

\subsection{Episodic Memory}
Personal experiences and related information are stored in the \emph{episodic memory} \citep{tulving_episodic_1972}.
This memory stores specific information and their temporal-spatial relationship \citep[][p.\,385]{tulving_episodic_1972}.
The information is grouped together by specific events, or so-called episodes.
Information is encoded based upon their autobiographical reference to already stored content \citep[][p.\,385f.]{tulving_episodic_1972}.
In addition, temporal and spatial information is stored including information about the situation as well as feelings \citep[][p.\,385f.]{tulving_episodic_1972}.
An episode has an explicit start and end while retaining a temporal order of information \citep[][p.\,262]{conway_construction_2000}.
Based upon recallable information about an episode, this episode can be re\=/experienced and thus enabling \emph{mental} time-travel.
This is denoted as memory-vividness \citep{conway_construction_2000}.
An episode is successfully memorized and retrieved, if the perceptual properties and their approximate temporal relationship to other episodes can be described \citep{conway_construction_2000}.
%The retrieval process can be supported by providing a cue.

The episodic segmentation process, \ie, constitution in the memory of an actor, is expected to happen during the actual experience \citep[][]{ezzyat_what_2011, kurby_segmentation_2008}.
Here, the goal of an actor and the temporal proximity of individual events are considered of special importance \citep[][]{black_episodes_1979}.
It must be noted that first-time episodes and repeated episodes are considered different with regard to memorization (\citet{conway_construction_2000} referencing \citet{barsalou_content_1988}).
The latter are linked by a shared theme, but tend to retain less specific information about individual episodes \citep{robinson_first_1992}.

The characteristic of the episodic memory affects retrospective judgments due to the grouping of information and thus the ability to recall.

\subsection{Effects on Retrospective Judgments}\label{chap03:effects}
For a \emph{retrospective judgment} of an experience, a person must rely on information about this experience that has been \emph{a)} perceived, \emph{b)} memorized and \emph{c)} can been recalled while conducting this judgment.
With regard to retrospective judgments major, work has been done for the judgment of pain, showing several, even counterintuitive, effects.
It has been found that not all parts of an experience affect a retrospective judgment equally.
Those effects are described in the following.

\paragraph*{Primacy and Recency}
Primacy and recency have first been observed for sequential learning \citep[][]{murdock_jr._serial_1962}.
In a sequential learning task, it has been found that the likelihood to recall specific items afterwards, depends on the position of an item.
Items at the very beginning and at the very end have an increased likelihood to be recalled correctly.
This is denoted as \emph{primacy effect} and \emph{recency effect}, respectively.
The former denotes an increased likelihood to recall items from the beginning and the latter the increased likelihood to recall final items.

With regard to retrospective judgments of one experience, a recency effect is often observed.
In an episode with varying pain the retrospective judgment is higher, \ie, the episode is judged less painful, if less pain occurs at the end \citep[][]{kahneman_when_1993, redelmeier_patients_1996}.
This could also be observed, if an episode is extended by a less painful ending.
An effect of primacy has not been observed for retrospective evaluation of pain, indicating that the beginning of such an experience has a reduced importance for the retrospective judgment.

\paragraph*{Peak}
For retrospective judgments of an experience, it has been observed that an outstanding part is overly represented in the retrospective judgment.
This is denoted as \emph{peak} effect.
Such an effect has been observed in retrospective assessment of pain \citep[][]{kahneman_when_1993, redelmeier_patients_1996}.
Here, a spike in \emph{momentary pain} results in a severely worse rated pain in a retrospective judgment.
It seems as if exceptional parts of an experience can either be better memorized, or are more likely to be recalled.
Peak effects are most often considered for \emph{negative} peaks, \eg, outstanding pain, but rarely for positive peaks, \eg, outstanding pleasure.

\paragraph*{Duration Neglect}
In retrospective judgments, a duration neglect has been found.
Here, it has been observed that the actual duration of an experience has only a reduced to no impact on a retrospective judgment.
This has been mainly observed for retrospective judgments of pain \citep[][]{fredrickson_duration_1993, ariely_combining_1998}.

\subparagraph*{}
This overview shows, that retrospective judgments of experiences are affected by characteristics of the episodic memory.
Here, information might not be recallable, not recalled precisely, or not considered with similar importance.
The observed effects/biases indicate that not all parts of an experience are equally important for a retrospective judgment.
Rather the formation process seems to assign a special importance to individual parts.
The observed biases have been used as basis for investigating retrospective judgments of perceived quality, which is presented in the following.
%Similar observations have also been made for \citet{hogarth_order_1992}
